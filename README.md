1. Getting Started with Spark
We kick off by setting up Spark and diving into the basics—loading data, running simple transformations, and witnessing how Spark processes data in parallel. This foundation sets the stage for everything that follows.

2. Mastering RDDs
Next, we explore RDDs—the heart of Spark’s power. We transform and combine data with map, filter, and reduce, learning how Spark handles data fault-tolerantly and efficiently behind the scenes.

3. Diving into Spark SQL
Then, we step into structured data. Using DataFrames and Spark SQL, we query and analyze complex datasets with ease, turning raw data into meaningful insights with familiar SQL commands.

4. Building Machine Learning Models
With the data prepped, we build and train machine learning models. From feature engineering to evaluating accuracy, we create pipelines that turn data into predictions—unlocking the power of scalable ML.

5. Uncovering Graph Patterns
Finally, we dive into graph analytics with GraphFrames. By mapping relationships and running algorithms like PageRank, we reveal hidden connections and influential nodes within complex networks.
